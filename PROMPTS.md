Here are all the prompts we used today:

```
I want to create a landing page for a patry management app that I am creating. This app will enable users to manager a party in a community with multiple moderators. Please create a README file in this project
```

```
I would like to use Astro and Tailwind CSS. A simple pastel color theme, earthy tone. Please update the document
```

```
Please add a CLAUDE.md for this project
```

```
Lets create a task to initiate the project, "Hello World" page only, just so I can test Astro and Tailwind is work. I would like a nice display font
```

```
Looks good. Now lets update the homepage to be a general user landing page, with a mantle, features list and generic testimonials. I would like a header and footer too
```

```
I think Tailwind styling is not applied. All the icons aare really large, filling page width. Layout is all in one column, no colors. Please check
```

```
I see hash URLs like /#testimonials, I would like regular URLs like /testimonials
```

```
Lets add a payment page, we have one $60 a year plan. Let's take users to Stripe if they click on CTA on the payment page
```

```
Is there a test Stripe checkout URL we could use?
```

```
The `Pay with Stripe` button does not do anything when clicked
```
